## 👋 About Me

Senior Full Stack Engineer with 10+ years of experience designing and delivering scalable, secure, production-grade systems across cloud-native and hybrid environments.

I specialize in **backend-first architecture**, distributed systems, and cloud-native infrastructure using:

- Node.js
- Python
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- AWS
- Docker & Kubernetes

I build systems that are clean, maintainable, and designed for long-term scalability.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

- Build for maintainability over cleverness  
- Separate concerns clearly  
- Write modular, testable systems  
- Automate infrastructure and deployments  
- Design with scale and security in mind  
- Document systems for future engineers
